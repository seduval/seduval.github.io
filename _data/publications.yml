-   title:  "MDS Matrices with Lightweight Circuits"
    summary: "MDS matrices are an important element for the design of block ciphers such
    as the AES. In recent years, there has been a lot of work on the construction of MDS
    matrices with a low implementation cost, in the context of lightweight cryptography.
    Most of the previous efforts focused on local optimization, constructing MDS matrices
    with coefficients that can be efficiently computed. In particular, this led to a matrix
    with a direct xor count of only 106, while a direct implementation of the MixColumn
    matrix of the AES requires 152 bitwise xors. \r\n
    More recently, techniques based on global optimization have been introduced, where
    the implementation can reuse some intermediate variables. In particular, Kranz et al.
    used optimization tools to find a good implementation from the description of an
    MDS matrix. They have lowered the cost of implementing the MixColumn matrix to
    97 bitwise xors, and proposed a new matrix with only 72 bitwise xors, the lowest cost
    known so far. \r\n
    In this work we propose a different approach to global optimization. Instead of
    looking for an optimized circuit of a given matrix, we run a search through a space of
    circuits, to find optimal circuits yielding MDS matrices. This results in MDS matrices
    with an even lower cost, with only 67 bitwise xors."

-   title: "A Generalisation of Dillon's APN Permutation With the Best Known Differential and Nonlinear Properties for All Fields of Size \\(2^{4k+2}\\)"
    summary: "The existence of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutations operating on an even number of variables was a long-standing open problem, until an example with six variables was exhibited by Dillon et al. in 2009. However it is still unknown whether this example can be generalized to any even number of inputs. In a recent work, Perrin et al. described an infinite family of permutations, named butterflies, operating on \\((4k+2)\\) variables and with differential uniformity at most 4, which contains the Dillon APN permutation. In this paper, we generalize this family, and we completely solve the two open problems raised by Perrin et al. Indeed we prove that all functions in this larger family have the best known nonlinearity. We also show that this family does not contain any APN permutation besides the Dillon permutation, implying that all other functions have differential uniformity exactly four."

-   title: "Cryptanalysis of the FLIP Family of Stream Ciphers"
    summary: "At Eurocrypt 2016, Méaux et al. proposed FLIP, a new family of stream ciphers intended for use in Fully Homomorphic Encryption systems. Unlike its competitors which either have a low initial noise that grows at each successive encryption, or a high constant noise, the FLIP family of ciphers achieves a low constant noise thanks to a new construction called filter permutator. In this paper, we present an attack on the early version of FLIP that exploits the structure of the filter function and the constant internal state of the cipher. Applying this attack to the two instantiations proposed by Méaux et al. allows for a key recovery in \\(2^{54}\\) basic operations (resp. \\(2^{68}\\)), compared to the claimed security of \\(2^{80}\\) (resp. \\(2^{128}\\))."

-   title: "Construction of Lightweight S-Boxes using Feistel and MISTY structures"
    summary: "The aim of this work is to find large S-Boxes, typically operating on \\(8\\) bits, having both good cryptographic properties and a low implementation cost. Such S-Boxes are suitable building-blocks in many lightweight block ciphers since they may achieve a better security level than designs based directly on smaller S-Boxes. We focus on S-Boxes corresponding to three rounds of a balanced Feistel and of a balanced MISTY structure, and generalize the recent results by Li and Wang on the best differential uniformity and linearity offered by such a construction. Most notably, we prove that Feistel networks supersede MISTY networks for the construction of \\(8\\)-bit permutations. Based on these results, we also provide a particular instantiation of an \\(8\\)-bit permutation with better properties than the S-Boxes used in several ciphers, including Robin, Fantomas or CRYPTON."
