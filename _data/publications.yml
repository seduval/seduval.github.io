    subtitle: "Towards Secure and Efficient Fresh Re-Keying"
    summary: "State-of-the-art re-keying schemes can be viewed as a tradeoff between efficient but heuristic solutions based on binary field multiplications, that are only secure if implemented with a sufficient amount of noise, and formal but more expensive solutions based on weak pseudorandom functions, that remain secure if the adversary accesses their output in full. Recent results on “crypto dark matter” (TCC 2018) suggest that low-complexity pseudorandom functions can be obtained by mixing linear functions over different small moduli. In this paper, we conjecture that by mixing some matrix multiplications in a prime field with a physical mapping similar to the leakage functions exploited in side-channel analysis, we can build efficient re-keying schemes based on “crypto-physical dark matter”, that remain secure against an adversary who can access noise-free measurements. We provide first analyzes of the security and implementation properties that such schemes provide. Precisely, we first show that they are more secure than the initial (heuristic) proposal by Medwed et al. (AFRICACRYPT 2010). For example, they can resist attacks put forward by Belaid et al. (ASIACRYPT 2014), satisfy some relevant cryptographic properties and can be connected to a “Learning with Physical Rounding” problem that shares some similarities with standard learning problems. We next show that they are significantly more efficient than the weak pseudorandom function proposed by Dziembowski et al. (CRYPTO 2016), by exhibiting hardware implementation results."

-   title:  "A Systematic Appraisal of Side Channel Evaluation Strategies"
    summary: "In this paper we examine the central question that is how well do side channel evaluation regimes capture the true security level of a product. Concretely, answering this question requires considering the optimality of the attack/evaluation strategy selected by the evaluator, and the various steps to instantiate it. We draw on a number of published works and discuss whether state-of-the-art solutions for the different steps of a side-channel security evaluation offer bounds or guarantees of optimality, or if they are inherently heuristic. We use this discussion to provide an informal rating of the steps’ optimality and to put forward where risks of overstated security levels remain."

-   title:  "Saturnin: a suite of lightweight symmetric algorithms for post-quantum security"
    summary: "The cryptographic algorithms needed to ensure the security of our communications have a cost. For devices with little computing power, whose number is expected to grow significantly with the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT), this cost can be a problem. A simple answer to this problem is a compromise on the security level: through a weaker round function or a smaller number of rounds, the security level can be decreased in order to cheapen the implementation of the cipher. At the same time, quantum computers are expected to disrupt the state of the art in cryptography in the near future. For public-key cryptography, the NIST has organized a dedicated process to standardize new algorithms. The impact of quantum computing is harder to assess in the symmetric case but its study is an active research area.
In this paper, we specify a new block cipher, Saturnin, and its usage in different modes to provide hashing and authenticated encryption in such a way that we can rigorously argue its security in the post-quantum setting. Its security analysis follows naturally from that of the AES, while our use of components that are easily implemented in a bitsliced fashion ensures a low cost for our primitives. Our aim is to provide a new lightweight suite of algorithms that performs well on small devices, in particular micro-controllers, while providing a high security level even in the presence of quantum computers. Saturnin is a 256-bit block cipher with a 256-bit key and an additional 9-bit parameter for domain separation. Using it, we built two authenticated ciphers and a hash function.
• Saturnin-CTR-Cascade is an authenticated cipher using the counter mode and a separate MAC. It requires two passes over the data but its implementation does not require the inverse block cipher.
• Saturnin-Short is an authenticated cipher intended for messages with a length strictly smaller than 128 bits which uses only one call to Saturnin to providenconfidentiality and integrity.
• Saturnin-Hash is a 256-bit hash function. 
In this paper, we specify this suite of algorithms and argue about their security in both the classical and the post-quantum setting."

-   title:  "Spook: Sponge-Based Leakage-Resistant Authenticated Encryption with a Masked Tweakable Block Cipher"
    summary: "This paper defines Spook: a sponge-based authenticated encryption with associated data algorithm. It is primarily designed to provide security against side-channel attacks at a low energy cost. For this purpose, Spook is mixing a leakageresistant mode of operation with bitslice ciphers enabling efficient and low latency implementations. The leakage-resistant mode of operation leverages a re-keying function to prevent differential side-channel analysis, a duplex sponge construction to efficiently process the data, and a tag verification based on a Tweakable Block Cipher (TBC) providing strong data integrity guarantees in the presence of leakages. The underlying bitslice ciphers are optimized for the masking countermeasures against side-channel attacks. Spook is an efficient single-pass algorithm. It ensures state-of-the-art black box security with several prominent features: (i) nonce misuse-resilience, (ii) beyond-birthday security with respect to the TBC block size, and (iii) multiuser security at minimum cost with a public tweak. Besides the specifications and design rationale, we provide first software and hardware implementation results of (unprotected) Spook which confirm the limited overheads that the use of two primitives sharing internal components imply. We also show that the integrity of Spook with leakage, so far analyzed with unbounded leakages for the duplex sponge and a strongly protected TBC modeled as leak-free, can be proven with a much weaker unpredictability assumption for the TBC. We finally discuss external cryptanalysis results and tweaks to improve both the security margins and efficiency of Spook."

-   title:  "Low AND Depth and Efficient Inverses: a Guide on S-boxes for Low-latency Masking"
    summary: "In this work, we perform an extensive investigation and construct a portfolio of S-boxes suitable for secure lightweight implementations, which aligns well with the ongoing NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition. In particular, we target good functional properties on the one hand and efficient implementations in terms of AND depth and AND gate complexity on the other. Moreover, we also consider the implementation of the inverse S-box and the possibility for it to share resources with the forward S-box. We take our exploration beyond the conventional small (and even) S-box sizes. Our investigation is twofold: (1) we note that implementations of existing S-boxes are not optimized for the criteria which define masking complexity (AND depth and AND gate complexity) and improve a tool published at FSE 2016 by Stoffelen in order to fill this gap. (2) We search for new S-box designs which take these implementation properties into account from the start. We perform a systematic search based on the properties of not only the S-box but also its inverse as well as an exploration of larger S-box sizes using length-doubling structures. The result of our investigation is not only a wide selection of very good S-boxes, but we also provide complete descriptions of their circuits, enabling their integration into future work."

-   title:  "Lightweight MACs from Universal Hash Functions"
    summary: "Lightweight cryptography is a topic of growing importance, with the goal to secure the communication of low-end devices that are not powerful enough to use conventional cryptography. There have been many recent proposals of lightweight block ciphers, but comparatively few results on lightweight Message Authentication Codes (MACs).
    
    Therefore, this paper focuses on lightweight MACs. We review some existing constructions, and revisit the choices made in mainstream MACs with a focus on lightweight cryptography. We consider MACs based on universal hash functions, because they offer information theoretic security, can be implemented efficiently and are widely used in conventional cryptography. However, many constructions used in practice (such as GMAC or Poly1305-AES) follow the Wegman-Carter-Shoup construction, which is only secure up to \\(2^64\\) queries with a 128-bit state.

    We point out that there are simple solutions to reach security beyond the birthday bound, and we propose a concrete instantiation,   𝖬𝖠𝖢𝟨𝟣𝟣 , reaching 61-bit security with a 61-bit universal hash function. We wrote an optimized implementation on two ARM micro-controllers, and we obtain very good performances on the Cortex-M4, at only 3.7 c/B for long messages, and less than one thousand cycles for short messages."

-   title:  "Constructions pour la cryptographie à bas coût"
    summary: "Cette thèse explore la construction de primitives de cryptographie symétrique. Nous parvenons à de meilleures constructions que celles de la littérature, en visant la réduction des coûts d'implémentation. Nous étudions trois types de primitives : les chiffrements par blocs, utilisées couramment pour le chiffrement symétrique, un chiffrement à flot utile pour une application spécifique et un algorithme d'authentification de messages.Nous réduisons les coûts des deux composants des chiffrements par blocs : la boîte-S et la matrice de diffusion. Les structures de Feistel et de type MISTY se révèlent performantes pour offrir une bonne sécurité à bas coût, et nous obtenons ainsi des boîtes-S offrant le meilleur compromis coût/sécurité connu. Nous étudions aussi la structure de Papillon qui produit des boîtes-S avec une excellente sécurité. Quant aux matrices de diffusion, nous développons un algorithme de recherche de matrices formelles, puis nous instancions les solutions pour obtenir des matrices optimales en termes de diffusion à des coûts moindres que celles de la littérature.Nous trouvons par ailleurs une faiblesse dans le chiffrement à flot FLIP créé pour répondre à des contraintes de coût spécifiques. Nous montrons que FLIP nécessite une étude différente des autres chiffrements à flot et en déduisons une attaque, ce qui a permis de mettre à jour FLIP pour obtenir un chiffrement à flot plus résistant.Enfin nous étudions les MAC, qui servent à l'authentification des messages. En combinant des idées de la littérature, nous créons un MAC moins coûteux que ceux utilisés en pratique pour une sécurité équivalente, en visant une implémentation sur micro-controlleurs 32 bits."

-   title:  "MDS Matrices with Lightweight Circuits"
    summary: "MDS matrices are an important element for the design of block ciphers such
    as the AES. In recent years, there has been a lot of work on the construction of MDS
    matrices with a low implementation cost, in the context of lightweight cryptography.
    Most of the previous efforts focused on local optimization, constructing MDS matrices
    with coefficients that can be efficiently computed. In particular, this led to a matrix
    with a direct xor count of only 106, while a direct implementation of the MixColumn
    matrix of the AES requires 152 bitwise xors. \r\n
    More recently, techniques based on global optimization have been introduced, where
    the implementation can reuse some intermediate variables. In particular, Kranz et al.
    used optimization tools to find a good implementation from the description of an
    MDS matrix. They have lowered the cost of implementing the MixColumn matrix to
    97 bitwise xors, and proposed a new matrix with only 72 bitwise xors, the lowest cost
    known so far. \r\n
    In this work we propose a different approach to global optimization. Instead of
    looking for an optimized circuit of a given matrix, we run a search through a space of
    circuits, to find optimal circuits yielding MDS matrices. This results in MDS matrices
    with an even lower cost, with only 67 bitwise xors."

-   title: "A Generalisation of Dillon's APN Permutation With the Best Known Differential and Nonlinear Properties for All Fields of Size \\(2^{4k+2}\\)"
    summary: "The existence of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutations operating on an even number of variables was a long-standing open problem, until an example with six variables was exhibited by Dillon et al. in 2009. However it is still unknown whether this example can be generalized to any even number of inputs. In a recent work, Perrin et al. described an infinite family of permutations, named butterflies, operating on \\((4k+2)\\) variables and with differential uniformity at most 4, which contains the Dillon APN permutation. In this paper, we generalize this family, and we completely solve the two open problems raised by Perrin et al. Indeed we prove that all functions in this larger family have the best known nonlinearity. We also show that this family does not contain any APN permutation besides the Dillon permutation, implying that all other functions have differential uniformity exactly four."

-   title: "Cryptanalysis of the FLIP Family of Stream Ciphers"
    summary: "At Eurocrypt 2016, Méaux et al. proposed FLIP, a new family of stream ciphers intended for use in Fully Homomorphic Encryption systems. Unlike its competitors which either have a low initial noise that grows at each successive encryption, or a high constant noise, the FLIP family of ciphers achieves a low constant noise thanks to a new construction called filter permutator. In this paper, we present an attack on the early version of FLIP that exploits the structure of the filter function and the constant internal state of the cipher. Applying this attack to the two instantiations proposed by Méaux et al. allows for a key recovery in \\(2^{54}\\) basic operations (resp. \\(2^{68}\\)), compared to the claimed security of \\(2^{80}\\) (resp. \\(2^{128}\\))."

-   title: "Construction of Lightweight S-Boxes using Feistel and MISTY structures"
    summary: "The aim of this work is to find large S-Boxes, typically operating on \\(8\\) bits, having both good cryptographic properties and a low implementation cost. Such S-Boxes are suitable building-blocks in many lightweight block ciphers since they may achieve a better security level than designs based directly on smaller S-Boxes. We focus on S-Boxes corresponding to three rounds of a balanced Feistel and of a balanced MISTY structure, and generalize the recent results by Li and Wang on the best differential uniformity and linearity offered by such a construction. Most notably, we prove that Feistel networks supersede MISTY networks for the construction of \\(8\\)-bit permutations. Based on these results, we also provide a particular instantiation of an \\(8\\)-bit permutation with better properties than the S-Boxes used in several ciphers, including Robin, Fantomas or CRYPTON."
