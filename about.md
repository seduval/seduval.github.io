summary: Information about SÃ©bastien Duval, PhD in cryptography, researcher at the mathematics laboratory of Versailles, France. My work is about symmetric-key cryptology, I design ciphers and MACs for encryption and authentication, with a special focus on the security of the Internet of Things (such as Spook). I also design security solutions for post-quantum cryptography like Saturnin (for when the attacker has access to a quantum computer), and perform attacks and cryptanalysis of cryptographic algorithms. Additionnally, I teach at Bachelor and Masters levels, in mathematics and computer science.
